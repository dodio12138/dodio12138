# 👋Hi, here is Levy Zhang!

I am an indie developer and trying to learn to be a full stack developer.

Now I am studying Robotics in QMUL.

I'm interested in a lot of things.

- Made MMD animations in college, learned how to use C4D modeling and rendering, made some short rendered films and animations. Have some knowledge of houdini and Zbrush. Now mainly use blender ( amazing software).
- My first camera was a sony α6300, I used it a lot to take videos and photos and learned image processing, video editing & post production.
